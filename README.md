a deep dive into the molecular landscape of pediatric AML at diagnosis and relapse

This data science project is aimed to identify new molecular information that could ultimately improve our understanding of, and future ability to manage, pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML is the second most common type of leukemia in children and relapse is the major root cause for AML-related death. Treatments for AML (e.g. incorporation of immunotherapy-based approaches) -- have not advanced to the same degree as the more common ALL. It is a heterogeneous disease and the molecular classification is complex. Currently, the disease is classified based on chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy; recurrent translocations) and a small set of gene mutations that impact overall risk classification (e.g. FLT3, NPM1, Ras-pathway, or CEBPA mutations). This molecular system has improved our understanding of AML biology and overall disease risk -- for example, MLL(KMT2A)-rearranged AML has emerged as a high risk entity, and these patients 

The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) AML subproject (a branch of the larger TARGET project) was started by the NCI and Children's Oncology Group to generate a repository of molecular information (WGS, WES, gene expression, microRNA expression, methylation) for pediatric cancer in the era of cancer genomics.
